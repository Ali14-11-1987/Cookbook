      <p>
        Cocktails are traditionally thought of as an American innovation, but
        they were actually at least partly inspired by British punches—big bowls
        of spirits mixed with fruit juice, spices, and other flavors, consumed
        in punch houses in the 18th century. The term cocktail was even first
        seen in a British newspaper printed March of 1798. But the term wasn’t
        really defined as we know it until 1806, when The Balance and Columbian
        Repository of Hudson, New York, pinned the cocktail down to what we
        follow today: “a stimulating liquor composed of any kind of sugar, water
        and bitters, vulgarly called a bittered sling.” (The sling had actually
        predated the cocktail, basically the same thing made without bitters.)
      </p>

      <h1>Prohibition</h1>
      <p>
        But then a little thing called Prohibition put a slight damper on
        cocktail consumption (and gave a big boost to organized crime). Even
        after it was repealed, many of our most talented bartenders had already
        found new homes abroad. In a sense, World Wars (and increased tourism)
        were a slight saving grace for cocktail culture, with exposure to the
        Pacific theater and its Polynesian culture introducing us to the kitsch
        and copious rums of what became our corrupted Tiki culture. Ernest
        Raymond Beaumont Gantt’s adopted Don the Beachcomber persona became an
        iconic Hollywood restaurant and Polynesian hot spot, while Victor
        Bergereon (aka “Trader Vic”) opened a self-named competing Tiki spot in
        San Francisco in the 1930s.

      <h1 class="h-elements">1. Oldfashioned</h1>

      <div>
        <p>
          An old fashioned is a classic whiskey cocktail with bitters, simple
          syrup, and fruit. Experts believe the drink is called the "old
          fashioned" because it's one of the first widely known cocktails ever.
          The name comes from people ordering the drink the "old-fashioned way.

        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <p>
          Here are the basic steps for how to make an old fashioned cocktail:
          Muddle the sugar. If you’re going the classic sugar cube route, add it
          to a lowball glass, top with the water and bitters, and use a muddler
          (or the end of a wooden spoon) to muddle and stir the mixture until
          the sugar is nearly dissolved. If you’re using a liquid sweetener such
          as maple syrup or simple syrup, you can skip this step and stir the
          sweetener and bitters directly into the bourbon. Mix.

      <h1 class="h-elements">2. Negroni</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          As the story goes, the Negroni was invented in a bar in Florence in
          the early 20th century by Italian Count Camillo Negroni. He asked the
          bartender to strengthen his cocktail, an Americano, so the bartender
          replaced the soda water with gin and added an orange peel instead of
          the Americano's typical lemon peel. Now the experimental drink of gin,
          vermouth, and Campari has become a popular cocktail even outside of
          Italy.

      <h1 class="h-elements">3.Mojito</h1>
      <div class="mojito">
        <p>
          Dating back to 16th-century Cuba, the Mojito — made from rum, lime,
          mint, and sugar — was supposedly consumed for medicinal purposes.
          Eventually, it became known as the Mojito, as it first appeared in the
          1932 edition of Sloppy Joe's Bar Cocktails Manual. Sloppy Joe's was a
          famed bar in Havana and the Mojito only consists of ingredients native
          to Cuba
